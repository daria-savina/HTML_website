					<br>about me !</h1>
				
				<div class="main-paragraph">
					<p><strong>I am a Software Engineer,</strong> working full time and studying programming in between!</p>
						
					<p>I enjoy traveling (especially adore mountains), ride a car and change time to time my homeplace.
					Besides, I love programming. </p>
					<p> I worked as a Data Analyst, BI Developer, Data Engineer.
						And right now developing myself <strong>in Big Data with focus on  Machine Learning.</strong></p>
					<p>I'm not familiar with drawing, art is not for me. But I get the beauty from the numbers.I enjoy working with them.
						And I learned how to express the beauty from my mind with AI, numbers and visualizations on dashboards.</p>
